This one was HAAAAAAARD
For all the other assignments Ive felt reasonably confident that I would be able to 
piece it together will enough time and willpower. I felt that way about this one...
at first. I think in all I spent around 9 hours working on it. The vast majority
of that time was practicing googlefu and in the end I had to ask for help
from my fellow classmates. Did I miss some vital information last week? Maybe Im 
not paying enough attention. At any rate, thanks to Sid and Dez I got it finished
but Im not half as confident with the product than with all my other assignments.
